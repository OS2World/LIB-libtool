v2.2.6b-r2 :
    Pass -Zxxx flags when linking DLLs
    Remove trailing CR of a executing command in func_show_eval ()
    Set lt_cv_sys_max_cmd_len to -1
    Do not relink when linking any uninstalled libtool libraries
    Do not export _DLL_InitTerm

    Specify 'TERMINSTANCE'.
    Replaced 'SINGLE NONSHARED' with 'MULTIPLE NONSHARED'.
